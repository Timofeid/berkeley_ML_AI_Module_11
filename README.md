Practical Application Assignment

This Jupyter Notebook contains a research project focused on analyzing and understanding what features make a car more or less expensive. The research is divided into several sections, each with its own methodology and results. Here is a brief summary of each section:

### Business and Data Understanding
Include tasks suitable for a data engineer. As well as an initial overview of a dataset and data quality.

### Data Preparation:

The dataset used in this research consists of car listings with various features such as year, manufacturer, condition, fuel type, odometer reading, and more.
The data cleaning section handles missing values, duplicates, and outliers. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:

This section explores the dataset and provides insights into the distribution and relationships between different variables.
Visualizations, such as scatter plots and histograms, are used to analyze the data.

### Data Preprocessing:

In this section, the dataset is preprocessed to prepare it for machine learning models.
Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding, and numerical variables are scaled using standardization.
The preprocessed dataset is split into training and testing sets.

### Model Development:

Several machine learning models are developed and evaluated to predict car prices.
Models include Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Transformed Target Regression.
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
Model Evaluation:

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE).
The best-performing model is selected based on its MSE score.
### Evaluation:

The findings section presents the results of the models and highlights actionable insights for a non-technical audience. It provides recommendations for improving car pricing strategies, such as considering the manufacturer, condition, fuel type, and title status when determining prices.

Overall, this research project demonstrates the process of analyzing and predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. It provides valuable insights into the factors that impact car prices and offers a predictive model that can be used for pricing analysis and decision-making in the automotive industry.
